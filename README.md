#### This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
 In This Project I made a data anlysis of a dataset [no-show-appointments.csv]
 * first I made a Data Wrangling for this csv file and I checked the data cleaning and this file has no missing values and checked duplicated rows.
   I remove some columns that I did not need to use it in this analysis.
   I convert some columns from data types to another.
 *  Explotory analysis for the dataset: I asked some questions and answer it from Data visualization
